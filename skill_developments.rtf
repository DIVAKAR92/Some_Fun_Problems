\f0\fs24 \cf0 Over the course of my PhD, I have improved my programming skills in C++ and R. These programming skills has not only improved my coding skills but also helped me greatly in thinking logically. Apart from my PhD, I help students on the one-to-one basis, both on voluntary and paid basis. Outside of my PhD work, I was helping a start-up design their product which aimed to rank the music bands based on the characteristics like upvotes, likes, views, attendance, outreach etc. I came-up with a metric which could be used by them to design their application. \

I am also an active participant of the data science hackathons. Recently I participated in one such hackathon sponsored by Facebook Research. The competition involved designing a classification algorithm to detect the trolling behaviour of people on the social media. My team was ranked second at the end of the competition. }
